Hello (again) {{{$username}}}!

First of all let me welcome you to 17beats.com! I am excited to read your haiku and I hope we can help eachother grow not only as writers but as human beings. 

My goal with this website is to make it as easy as possible for you to spread your haiku and for you to read and comment on other works. So one of the things I have decided to do is give you your own email address to save haiku as a draft to your account.

This email address is {{{$username}}}-{{{$email_hash}}}@submit.17beats.com

All you need to do is send an email to that address and it will be saved as a draft. If you did not know before (I didn't, and I'm a programmer!) you can send text messages to email addresses without a data plan. The message simply counts as a text message (standard rates apply) and it will be saved to your DRAFTS. So save this address to your cellphone and write when the mood strikes! You can then logon when you have time and edit/submit a final version. Note that you have a limited amount of drafts allowed (this number fluxuates depending on usage, but it ranges from 25-50) so be sure to clean out your draft folder when you have time.

I do not want to filter your ideas, however I will not tolerate any illegal material (illegal in the USA) on the website. Be sure to read the about section for the terms and conditions you agreed to when you signed up.

As always, if you have questions or problems feel free to email support@17beats.com

And of course Peace and Love!
Matt.
